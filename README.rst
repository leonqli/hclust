Introduction: what is hclust?
-----------------------------

**hclust** is a pure-Python module for performing agglomerative (bottom up)
hierarchical clustering, employing any of complete linkage clustering,
single-linkage clustering, or mean linkage clustering.  See the
`User's guide <https://github.com/mstrosaker/hclust/wiki/User's-guide>`_
for more details.

Prerequisites
-------------

**hclust** has been tested with Python versions 2.6 and 2.7.

Installing
----------

The source distribution for the most recent version can be obtained from
the `hclust project page <https://github.com/mstrosaker/hclust>`_  by
clicking on the Download ZIP button.  The module can be installed with::

    > python setup.py install

Since **hclust** is a work in progress, it's recommended to have the most
recent version of the code.

How to use it?
--------------

**hclust** is a regular Python module: you import and invoke it from your
own code. For a detailed usage guide and links to examples, please consult the
`user's guide <https://github.com/mstrosaker/hclust/wiki/User's-guide>`_.
